# Contributing

If you have any ideas for improvements or new features, please just submit a pull request following the guidelines below. If you think you can improve Callio, but don't really know how to implement your ideas, please open an [issue](https://github.com/netguru/callio/issues) and we'll discuss it in the comments.

## Pull Requests

Before submitting any changes, please make sure you know how to [contribute to open source projects on GitHub](https://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/). Bear in mind that here in Callio, word *contributing* actually means adding some extra value to the project, which means:

* fixing existing bugs
* adding new features
* refactoring the existing codebase in terms of its functionality, readability or performance

If you're about to submit some code related to one of the topics above, please follow these instructions:

* Fork the project
* Use a topic/feature branch to easily amend a pull request later, if necessary
* Write [good commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
* Try to use the same coding conventions as the rest of the project
* Commit and push when you think you're ready with your contribution
* Don't forget to add tests for the code you're about to merge. Tests are really **important**
* Double check that all the previously written tests are passing along with the new ones
* Make sure the code you wrote doesn't produce RuboCop offenses
